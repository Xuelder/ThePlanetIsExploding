# ThePlanetIsExploding
Game made for the 2019 Global Game Jam in Twine

The planetary colony you grew up on is about to explode, the evacuation order has been given, and you can only take three of your worldly possessions. However, you only have two minutes, and you can only play this scenario once.

Made for the 2019 Global Game Jam. The theme was "What Home Means to You," and I took the Ephemeral Diversifier, a challenge to make it so the game can only be played once (Though technically you could play it again if you cleared your cache or opened it in a private window...).
